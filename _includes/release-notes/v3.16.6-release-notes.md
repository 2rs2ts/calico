#### Changes

 - All components that use Typha now use the same logic to discover Typha's address.  They lookup the endpoints of the service directly and connect to one at random.  This avoids a dependency on kube-proxy. [typha #465](https://github.com/projectcalico/typha/pull/465) (@fasaxc)
 - Rebuild with updated base images to pull in security fixes.
