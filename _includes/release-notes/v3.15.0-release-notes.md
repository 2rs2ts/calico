#### Encryption using Wireguard is generally available

Calico v3.14 introduced tech-preview support for encryption using Wireguard. In v3.15, weâ€™re excited to announce that this feature is promoted to GA.
To give it a spin, head on over to [the encryption how-to guide](https://docs.projectcalico.org/v3.15/security/encrypt-cluster-pod-traffic).

#### Datastore migration support

Calico supports two methods of data storage - directly via etcd, or via the Kubernetes API server. Calico v3.15 introduces a procedure for migrating Calico data from an etcd data store to the Kubernetes API for users who wish to do so. Using the Kubernetes API for data storage is operationally simpler, and allows users to leverage the rich Kubernetes RBAC model.

Read more in the [datastore migration guide](https://docs.projectcalico.org/v3.15/maintenance/datastore-migration).

#### OpenStack Ussuri support

In v3.15, Calico's OpenStack integration code has been updated to run under Python 3 and specifically with the Ussuri OpenStack release.

For more detail please see our [OpenStack docs](https://docs.projectcalico.org/v3.15/getting-started/openstack/requirements).
